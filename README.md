# Terragrunt repo reference
This repository aims to help you on your way to adopting terragrunt.

Here you will find examples for:
 * Dependency consumption
 * Variable and folder structure
 * Role assumption, for the provider
 * Global tags (and the importance of having a module for tags)
 * Outputs and weird things like using yamls for inputs.

WIP: add more documentation
